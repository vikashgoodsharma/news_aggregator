# React + Vite

I've used REACT+VITE setup to create this project

# setup

1. npm install ----> to install the dependencies
2. npm run dev ----> to run the project

# News API Used

1. News API
2. Gaurdian
3. NYT

Note: keys for all the three News sources are in constants.js file

# Structure

1. Container folder in src contains all the pages. i.e. I've created base.jsx file for the base page
2. Components folder in src contains all the components. i.e. Article Card.
3. Approuter file contains the Routing logic that is separate from app.jsx for better scalablity
